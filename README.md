## Flicker Mitigation schemes for Visual Light Communication Systems

I implemented two schemes for flicker mitigation in VLC systems on FPGA board

#### Tools used:
* Vivado
* Xilinx system generator
* MATLAB and Simulink

Note: Generated bit files are included separately which can be used to program the FPGA board directly using Vivado
